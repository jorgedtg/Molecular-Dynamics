Molecular Dynamics Simulation.

The project involved simulating molecular dynamics using the Velocity-Verlet algorithm. The objective was to
model the motion of particles under a Lennard-Jones potential, applying the classical equations of motion to
calculate the position and velocity of particles in a system. The simulation allowed for studying the dynamics of
particles in a controlled environment, focusing on the analysis of system behavior and thermodynamic properties.
